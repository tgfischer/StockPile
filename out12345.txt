Those tactics are easier for Delta and others to replicate.\nThe unbundling of amenities that come with a ticket is a move Delta deployed to compete with budget upstart Spirit Airlines Inc at home. In July, Delta said it plans to have the so-called \"basic economy\" product in all international markets in 2018, and a spokeswoman said Thursday that it already is on offer for some international destinations such as London and Glasgow.\nDelta, the No.2 airline globally by passenger traffic, said Thursday that trans-Atlantic revenue fell 8 percent in the third quarter from a year ago. It attributed this in part to flights on low-cost airlines and luxury Gulf carriers like Emirates [EMIRA.UL] exceeding demand.\nAccording to air travel intelligence company OAG, one-way flights on Norwegian across the Atlantic grew 44 percent to 2,916 this year, after increasing 34 percent in 2015. This includes new service between New York and Paris, a hub for Air France.\nNorwegian\u0027s schedule is dwarfed by Delta\u0027s more than 22,000 trans-Atlantic flights, but the added service is undermining efforts by Delta and other legacy carriers to shrink trans-Atlantic capacity and firm up prices that have been falling.\nThe data reflects schedules as of Sept. 9.\nThe biggest U.S. airlines and unions have turned to regulators to ease the pressure.\nFor more than two years, the U.S. Transportation Department has yet to finalize approval of flights that Norwegian has petitioned to start under an Irish subsidiary, in part because many in the U.S. industry say it would undermine wages and working standards. Norwegian has disputed the claims. The European Commission is now seeking arbitration because of the delay.\nNorwegian\u0027s Chief Commercial Officer Thomas Ramdahl has estimated that about 20 percent of the airline\u0027s long-haul passengers are snatched from rivals. The majority are choosing their European destinations in the first place because of Norwegian\u0027s low fares, he told Reuters in an interview last month.\n(Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin in New York; Additional Reporting by Victoria Bryan in Berlin; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2016/10/13/business/13reuters-airlines-fares.html","timestamp":"2016-10-15T21:17:47.358"}

BODY{"time":6,"sentiment":{"type":"negative","score":-0.578125},"lang":"en","text":"Years After United Merger, Flight Attendants Work for Two Airlines\nDespite the name on its airplanes, United Airlines is anything but fully unified.\nMore than five years after United merged with Continental, the combined carrier’s 24,000 flight attendants are still operating as if the company were running two airlines. That disconnect has made scheduling crews and flight routes more complicated and has contributed to operational challenges, including flight delays.\nNow, after three years of negotiations, the airline and its flight attendants seem to be near an agreement that could integrate the work force.\nUnited management and the Association of Flight Attendants, the union representing the airline’s cabin workers, are scheduled to meet for four days in Chicago next week in what both parties hope is a final mediation session. A new contract would unify all the flight attendants on issues like health care plans, wages and scheduling.\n“We feel optimistic,” said Sara Nelson, the union’s international president and a United flight attendant for 20 years.\nStill, the union has sought to keep up the pressure. It has staged demonstrations outside major airports eight times over the last year, including informational pickets on Thursday from Newark to Hong Kong.\nUnited said it was committed to getting the flight attendants a new contract.\nWhile United’s pilots, dispatchers and machinists have all reached new agreements with the company, the flight attendants have operated under separate contracts. That has meant pre-merger United flight attendants working exclusively on legacy United planes, and the former Continental flight attendants on Continental planes.\nNew hires and new airplanes are also divided between the two.\nSince the merger in October 2010, about 6 percent of United flights have been delayed because of complications within the airline’s control, like crew scheduling or maintenance problems, according to the Department of Transportation. But in 2009, that number was 4 percent.\nThe chief executive, Oscar Munoz, returned to his job in March after a lengthy absence during which he had a heart transplant, and industry analysts are watching for the airline to turn a corner. On-time rates started inching up earlier this year, which is one indication of improvement, said Craig Jenks, president of Airline/Aircraft Projects, an airline consulting firm in New York.\n“Investors are keeping their fingers crossed that positive change is happening at United, and that comprises both employee morale and customer issues,” Mr. Jenks said.\nBut in other areas, the company is still struggling. United has reported declines in passenger revenue for every seat-mile, a key metric in the industry.\nThe airline blames a strong dollar, which has contributed to weak demand in international markets, and low oil prices, which have reduced revenue from fuel surcharges and curbed traffic in Houston, an energy center that is one of United’s largest hubs.\nJames Compton, United’s chief revenue officer, said in April that the passenger revenue for every seat-mile could decline another 6.5 to 8.5 percent year over year in the second quarter, which ends in June, after falling for several quarters. That is a gloomier revenue forecast than those of the two larger United States carriers by revenue, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines.\nBoth employee morale and customer satisfaction have suffered. In a survey by Skytrax, an air travel research group, passengers have given United a grade of 3 out of 10, compared with grades of 5 for Delta and 6 for Southwest. Lufthansa, the German airline, received a 7.\nLabor peace is at the top of Mr. Munoz’s agenda. He was named to the post last fall after the previous chief, Jeffery A. Smisek, resigned in the face of a corruption investigation related to the company’s dealings with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.\nIn April, United reached an agreement with its 30,000 on-the-ground airport workers, represented by the International Association of Machinists \u0026 Aerospace Workers. Those workers will receive a 30 percent pay raise over the next five years.\nWhile the flight attendants are also pushing for a raise, United rejected their initial compensation plan, saying the proposal was “significantly more costly than at American and Delta and would have a negative impact on United’s ability to operate the airline.”\nThe Association of Professional Flight Attendants negotiated a 6 percent pay increase for American Airlines Group flight attendants earlier this year. Under that contract, American will adjust its pay scale once United reaches a deal with its flight attendants. Ms. Nelson said she hoped the provision would lead to higher wages throughout the industry.\nOne provision that is not an issue in these negotiations is employee seniority, a point of contention for pilots in recent airline mergers because it factors into how pilots and flight attendants can be scheduled on their preferred routes. In United’s case, the flight attendants agreed early on to base seniority on the original hire date, without regard to whether the employee worked for pre-merger United or Continental.\nUnited also has yet to strike a deal with its 9,000 mechanics, represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. It is scheduled to meet with that group later this month.\nOn his first official day back on the job in March, Mr. Munoz met with the major unions, and the change from the previous leadership was like “night and day,” said Ms. Nelson, the flight attendants’ leader.\nShe added, “Once he was engaged and pressing for an agreement, there was movement at the table.”","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/business/years-after-united-merger-flight-attendants-work-for-two-airlines.html","timestamp":"2016-10-15T21:17:47.667"}

Their trade group, Airlines for America, contends that the bill, which has bipartisan support, overreaches. Since 1990, the industry has more than halved its rate of mishandled bags, which is now at 3.24 per 1,000 pieces of checked luggage, down from 6.84, according to Vaughn Jennings, a spokesman. “Customer service decisions are best left to the dedicated airline employees who interact with and receive feedback from their customers every day — not government,” he said.\nThose decisions have led to the following result: In just a decade, the major American airlines have gone from taking in little in à la carte fees for things like baggage, early boarding and premium seating, to raking in $7.4 billion in 2015 alone, according to a study by the travel industry firms IdeaWorks and CarTrawler.\nA healthy airline industry is a great thing. Still, are all these fees just a naked grab for profits, or merely an attempt to have passengers pay for only the services that they are actually using?\nAnd if you did not get what you paid for, you ought to be persistent in your attempts to get the money back. Here’s how the process breaks down — and I mean that in every sense of the term.\nHAGGLING WITH THE AIRLINE In December, my family and I checked some bags on a domestic Delta Air Lines flight and did not get them back until 30 hours later. It seemed as if a refund was in order, but it took some effort to get Delta agents to even acknowledge that there was a way to request one.\nOn its online form, Delta says it “may” elect to give you a “rebate” if 12 hours pass between the time you report the wayward bags and your receiving them. To start that process, Delta wants ticket numbers, baggage claim numbers and the file reference number it gives you when your bags don’t show up. You should have your paperwork in order.\nAnd that “rebate?” If Delta grants one, you’ll get a voucher for future use on Delta. You know, the same airline that you’re super annoyed with for having left you with just your dirty winter clothes in a warm climate with no toothpaste and an infant to clothe. (We eventually bought more clothes, and Delta reimbursed us in full. At least we weren’t on Spirit, which reserves the right to “request” that you return the things you bought.)\nYou may forget you have that voucher, even if you are willing to fly Delta again. But you’d better not forget, because it expires in a year. Delta would not disclose the percentage of passengers who end up using these vouchers. The airline does give members of its frequent flier program 2,500 frequent flier miles if they have to wait more than 20 minutes at the carousel after a domestic flight, but only if they know to ask for it via another online form and do so within three days.\nDISPUTING FEES WITH YOUR CARD COMPANY Having given Delta an opportunity to fix the problem only to find that I could not get my money back, I called up American Express, my credit card issuer, to dispute the baggage fee charges. The dispute process can be an incredibly powerful tool for aggrieved consumers, and you can learn more about it in my 2013 column on the topic.\nWhen I got a representative on the phone, however, she informed me that I was not allowed to dispute this fee. Why not? Because of an agreement that the airline has with American Express, she said.\nThis seemed unfair, but I’d heard similar reports from consumers over the years about other card companies. According to Molly Faust, a spokeswoman for American Express, the company doesn’t have much flexibility, given how airlines set up the fees in the first place. In the so-called contract of carriage, the airlines can and do declare many fees nonrefundable. When that happens, and the service is rendered, according to Ms. Faust, American Express tries to educate cardholders about how the fee rules work and generally won’t be able to get them a refund.\nDespite the insistence of my American Express representative on the phone, Delta’s contract of carriage does not describe its baggage fees as nonrefundable, though those for United, Spiritand American do. Delta does, however, describe other fees this way. Perhaps that’s why, after a lot of badgering from me, the American Express phone representative eventually filed my dispute after all. Ultimately, it was successful. Most people would not be that persistent, though.\nSpokeswomen for Capital One, JPMorgan Chase and Citibank all said that they allowed airline fee disputes. If you’ve had a different experience, please let me know in the comments.\nTURN TO WASHINGTON Depending on what happens to the new legislation, it’s possible that some of the bag fee angst will go away. The Senate version of the bill calls for airlines to automatically refund the baggage fees when travelers do not get their luggage within six hours of their arrival on a domestic flight or 12 hours on an international one. The House version gives a 24-hour deadline, and the delivery of the refund would not be automatic.\nBoth passages are pretty generous to the airlines. Baggage service used to be free. Now that it generally isn’t, should they really get a free pass if your bags come on the next flight four hours later and you have to deal with the logistics of making sure they get to you?\nStill, the automatic nature of the Senate proposal is a big deal. If it does become automatic, it will no longer be your responsibility to type numbers into web forms. Instead, the refund would just happen. Also, it would be an actual refund on your card statement. Staff members working on the bill say that vouchers will not be allowed. Good riddance.\nMEANWHILE, MAKE THESE MOVES It will probably be a year or two before these provisions take effect. So while you’re waiting, you could try a couple of things to avoid baggage fees if checking your luggage is a necessity.\nFirst, fly Southwest. It doesn’t charge fees for the first two checked bags. If you have elite status on an airline, you can generally avoid fees that way, and many carriers have credit card-issuing partners that in exchange for the card’s overall annual fee, will offer free luggage checking of some sort.\nBut if you’re stuck paying fees on a carrier that gives you grief when the bags don’t come on time, dispute those charges and dispute them often. Another thing that gets the carrier’s attention is your filing a complaint with the Department of Transportation.\nIf enough of us protest just once or twice a year, the airlines may get so sick of responding that they will automate refunds, whether our elected representatives force them to or not.","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/16/your-money/reclaiming-fees-when-airline-luggage-goes-astray.html","timestamp":"2016-10-15T21:17:48.509"}

We don’t know your home address,” Mr. Koum wrote in a blog post at the time. “None of that data has ever been collected and stored by WhatsApp, and we really have no plans to change that.”\nTwo years later, in a move that is rankling some of the company’s more than one billion users, WhatsApp will soon begin to share some member information with Facebook.\nWhatsApp said on Thursday that it would start disclosing the phone numbers and analytics data of its users to Facebook. It will be the first time the messaging service has connected users’ accounts to the social network to share data, as Facebook tries to coordinate information across its collection of businesses.\nWhatsApp is changing its policy as it begins building a moneymaking business after long placing little emphasis on revenue. The company plans to allow businesses to contact customers directly through its platform. A similar strategy is already beingtested on Facebook Messenger, a separate messaging service Facebook owns.\n“We want to explore ways for you to communicate with businesses that matter to you, too, while still giving you an experience without third-party banner ads and spam,” WhatsApp said in a blog post announcing the changes to its privacy policy.\nAmong the changes, Facebook will be able to use a person’s phone number to improve other Facebook-operated services, such as making new Facebook friend suggestions, or better-tailored advertising, WhatsApp added. It said the data-sharing would also be used to fight spam text messages across its service.\nWhatsApp emphasized that neither it nor Facebook would be able to read users’ encrypted messages and that individual phone numbers would not be given to advertisers. WhatsApp users are still required to provide a phone number only to sign up for the service, and can opt out of giving it to Facebook.\nWhile WhatsApp operates autonomously from Facebook, Mr. Koum sits on Facebook’s board.\nThe changes were immediately viewed with a critical eye by some who were concerned when Facebook bought WhatsApp that their data could one day be misused. WhatsApp made early inroads with people worldwide partly for its hard-line stance on privacy and individual liberties, which was rooted in Mr. Koum’s youth in the 1980s in the Soviet Union, where, he has said, he lived in fear of his communications being monitored. Mr. Koum has also been outspoken against advertising in the app in general.\nMany WhatsApp users have appreciated just how different the service is from Facebook. In some countries, like Brazil, WhatsApp’s focus on privacy has led to criticism from law enforcement agencies that they cannot gain access to users’ encrypted messages.\n“Our values and our respect for your privacy continue to guide the decisions we make at WhatsApp,” Mr. Koum said in a post on Thursday. “It’s why we’ve rolled out end-to-end encryption, which means no one can read your messages other than the people you talk to. Not us, not Facebook, nor anyone else.”\nHe added, “Our focus is the same as it’s always been — giving you a fast, simple and reliable way to stay in touch with friends and loved ones around the world.”\nWhatsApp’s privacy policy overhaul raises concerns about potential legal challenges. Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy advocacy group in Washington, said it would file a complaint on Monday with the Federal Trade Commission to stop WhatsApp from sharing users’ data with Facebook. The group filed a similar case in 2014, citing promises that WhatsApp had made to protect individuals’ privacy.\n“Many users signed up for WhatsApp and not Facebook, precisely because WhatsApp offered, at the time, better privacy practices,” Mr. Rotenberg said by email. “If the F.T.C. does not bring an enforcement action, it means that even when users choose better privacy services, there is no guarantee their data will be protected.”\nSimilar legal steps could be taken abroad, where data protection rules are tougher. In Europe, for instance, several national regulators have already taken legal action against Facebook, claiming that it illegally collected information online about people who were not signed up on the social network. Facebook has denied the accusations.\nFacebook has also been at the heart of a debate over how people’s information held in Europe — the company’s users outside the United States are regulated from Dublin — should be transferred to the United States.\nIn a legal case involving Facebook last year, Europe’s top court ruled that American privacy standards did not offer sufficient protections to the region’s citizens. The court, the European Court of Justice, also invalidated the so-called safe harbor agreement that permitted technology giants and 4,000 other companies to routinely move data across the Atlantic.\nA new data-transfer pact, known as the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield, recently came into force, but it is facing legal challenges as privacy campaigners remain concerned that data held in Europe could be improperly read by government agencies when moved to the United States.\nWhatsApp’s new privacy policy may put it in the middle of this tussle, pushing the company to reassure concerned users about how Facebook may use their data.","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/26/technology/relaxing-privacy-vow-whatsapp-to-share-some-data-with-facebook.html","timestamp":"2016-10-15T21:19:24.952"}

But if he manages to make the way people connect to the Internet more affordable, it would be just the latest instance of how the company has quietly upended the traditional economics of the technology industry.\nFacebook has changed the way people interact with their friends on the Internet. But less understood outside tech circles is how the social network has come to be perhaps the most aggressive example of a growing number of companies that are unwilling to pay top dollar for products made by traditional technology suppliers.\nMr. Zuckerberg has embraced so-called open-source concepts, which have helped him play catch-up with the giant computer networks of companies like Amazon and Google.\nOpen source typically refers to freely shared code or even development plans that companies and people collectively create at a fraction of the price of traditional tech products. Bits of open-source technology can be found in all sorts of things, including Google’s Android operating system and web browsers.\nCompanies like Facebook often contribute to open-source projects since they don’t make money selling products — instead, they have to buy products that help them offer their service. Keeping tech costs down helps the bottom line.\nThis sort of enlightened self-interest sounds simple, but its impact has been dramatic. In 2000, for example, Sun Microsystems was worth $110 billion thanks to demand for its computer servers and workstations. A decade later the company was sold for $7.4 billion. Sun fell to cheaper competition from Linux, the popular open-source code that now runs many of Facebook’s servers.\nWhen Facebook reveals the financial results for its most recent quarter on Wednesday, investors will no doubt scrutinize how much the company is spending, particularly since Mr. Zuckerberg has promised to invest more money in searching for new users. One big key to keeping those costs down has been open-source technology.\nIncreasingly, Facebook does its own work on planning the computer hardware and software that it uses to deliver its services. It even released asopen source the design of the racks where its servers operate.\nIt should not be surprising, then, that Mr. Zuckerberg is relying on open source to reduce the price of building and running the world’s telecommunications networks, a business estimated to be worth about $150 billion a year.\n“Our rule is 10 times faster or 10 times cheaper or both,” said Jay Parikh, Facebook’s vice president for engineering. “We want to get a full Facebook experience to every end user, whether that is video, or eventually virtual reality.”\nEstablished telecommunications companies are moving fast to adjust. Nokia, the Finnish company, joined Facebook in February at the announcement of the Telecom Infra Project, or TIP, a Facebook-led group that is trying to reduce telecom costs. Cisco Systems intends to start donating software to TIP, hoping to profit from heavy overall usage on the world’s big telecom systems.\n“There is a new force in the system,” said Dave Ward, Cisco’s chief architect. “We’d rather be on the train than in front of it.”\nIn the future, Mr. Zuckerberg imagines that “a physical thing, like a TV, will just be a $1 app” inside virtual reality on Facebook, he recently told a conference of software developers building apps for Facebook. But that may be 10 years off, by Mr. Zuckerberg’s own admission. People who do not work at Facebook might say it is a fantasy.\nFacebook even appears willing to turn the price-crushing model on itself. To get virtual reality to every place in the world, Facebook’s Oculus VR headsets, currently $600, may have to cost $5, said Mike Schroepfer, the company’s chief technology officer.\nIs that another fantasy? For Facebook, getting those costs down could mean controlling the next big communications platform, since Mr. Zuckerberg believes virtual reality may eventually supplant smartphones as a primary connection to the online world.\n“The world is making enough phones. It’s better for the world if there are fewer devices,” Mr. Schroepfer said. “It’s not totally obvious how all this shakes out — whether we’ll have lots of consumer products, or it all disappears into a couple of VR headsets.”\nHow much profit this new audience will yield Facebook is an open question. But Facebook would rather control a crucial technology than have to build on top of another company’s products, as it has had to do with PCs and smartphones.\n“It’s more opportunity to show ads,” said Danny Sullivan, founder of the technology website Search Engine Land, who is a close watcher of the industry. “It’s more opportunity to gather data on what we do or who we are connected with. It’s more opportunity to build a new platform where Facebook serves as the broker of connectivity.”\nAt the same Facebook developers’ conference there were talks on the latest open-source efforts, including an urban wireless network that checks its performance 125,000 times a second, and a long-range wireless system that Facebook says can send a gigabit of data a second, about 10 times the rate of today’s good-performing networks and enough for virtual reality.\nBoth technologies, Mr. Parikh said, will be tested this year, with an eye to releasing them as open-source projects. “We’ll be into all this stuff,” he said. Facebook does not want to own or sell the gear, he added, but plans to work with “hundreds” of local phone companies worldwide on cheaper high-speed connections.\nFacebook isn’t alone in tackling the economics of connecting to the Internet. Google is aiming its Fiber service at radically cutting prices compared with what cable companies charge. Inside Amazon’s cloud computing business is a company called Twilio, which supplies inexpensive phone and video services.\nBut others dismiss some of Facebook’s efforts as hype. “We are connecting 700 million to 1.5 billion people a year via smartphones and tablets,” said Ulf Ewaldsson, chief technical officer at Ericsson, one of the world’s largest makers of telecommunications hardware.\n“They say they can do a 90 percent cost reduction, but that is from phone bills for high-cost customers,” he said. “Poor people need to be covered, and the industry is working on that.”","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/25/technology/facebook-aims-to-drive-down-tech-prices-to-expand-its-reach.html","timestamp":"2016-10-15T21:19:25.118"}

Vimeo, which hosts videos that can be much longer, counts a view instantly, as does Twitch, on which broadcasts can last hours. YouTube has never fully disclosed its methods for counting views, but industry insiders have divined that it is somewhere around 30 seconds.\nFor decades, TV viewership was measured primarily by one company, Nielsen, and expressed as relatively straightforward ratings — a currency upon which 30- and 60-second television ads were bought and sold. Digital video pairs more precise measurement with a vast proliferation of metrics and formats: videos viewed live, or later; on phones, computers or other devices; with obvious intention, after a search, or more incidentally, as in a feed filled with other posts; for seconds, minutes or hours.\nEven within the same company’s online entities, data is hard to reconcile. “You have Twitter now with live video, then you have a Periscope product, then you have Vine, and they all integrate into this feed,” said Nick Cicero, founder of Delmondo, a social media marketing and analytics firm. “Then you have Twitter on TV, where you can watch live video from your couch.”\n“It’s really hard to say what is comparable to what,” he said.\nThose who post videos can afford to look at these shifting definitions of what counts as a view with at least a modicum of humor.\nBut for the advertising industry, audience measurements translate directly into dollar amounts, and the different methods to measure views — and the fact that the information is all self-reported by the technology companies — are problems. Then came the recent admission byFacebook that for years it had miscalculated its video viewing metric, giving its partners the impression that their videos had been viewed for longer, on average, than they actually had been.\nThe Association of National Advertisers, a trade group, took the opportunity to scold Facebook, which has rapidly altered the online advertising industry. “With more than $6 billion of marketers’ media being directed to Facebook, we believe that it is time for them — and other such major media players — to be audited and accredited,” the agency’s chief executive, Bob Liodice, said in a statement.\nSuch demands are not entirely new, and some websites, in an effort to appease and court clients and partners, have already begun to take tentative steps in that direction. In April, Facebook announced a series of deals with Integral Ad Science, comScore and Nielsen to offer third-party verification. It also made a deal with a company called Moat, which seeks to standardize some forms of measurement across websites that host video. YouTube, Twitter and Snapchat have made similar deals in recent years.\n“We think it is really important to have a standard set of metrics like audience reach, total minutes, average minutes viewed,” said Jessica Hogue, senior vice president for product leadership at Nielsen. “The market doesn’t want more metrics, just a refined set applied in a consistent manner regardless of the content type or platform.”\nThough it has recently been criticized for failing to keep up with TV’s digital revolution, Nielsen has for decades offered familiar ratings and is hoping to find its place — by creating simple, Nielsen-like ratings across different services — despite competition. The use of familiar measurement methodology may help persuade advertisers to move more of their spending from TV, where the bulk of it has traditionally gone, to digital.\nFacebook’s stumble may represent the beginning of a bigger conflict between sites that host video and advertisers.\nConsistent measurement, which could allow views on one site to be compared directly with views on another, could streamline and accelerate advertiser spending. (Reverse-engineering each company’s counting methods has actually become something of a sport among marketing professionals.)\n“Every other medium has a currency,” said Jonah Goodhart, the founder of Moat. “You can measure time in the same way across platforms even if the impact of time is different on those platforms.”\nBut such standardization could also diminish what platforms regard as their own unique advantages that cannot always be captured in raw numbers — differences in the ways users use particular apps, and consume video, that could command a premium.\nIt is in a platform’s interest, in other words, to be regarded as a different medium than its competitors, measured not just in views or time spent watching.\n“What you’re going to have is a whole bunch of ad sales people trying to make the case as to why their thing is better,” said Tony Haile, the founder and former chief of Chartbeat, an analytics company. “But it’s going to be very difficult to try to match the experiential differences on the platforms to the media buyer’s desire for a simple message about performance.”\nA compromise, he suggested, could be a clearer distinction between public metrics — view counts displayed to influence users’ behavior or provide positive feedback to those who post — and the numbers the companies use to sell advertising.\nAlready on Facebook, advertisers are able to buy video impressions, which are counted as soon as someone sees a video, or 10-second views, which are more expensive and counted only if the user makes it to 10 seconds. But the three-second view, the one behind the totals the public sees, is not for sale.\n“A video view which isn’t being transacted on, but which is there to make someone feel good about how many views their video received, is useful for a totally different purpose,” Mr. Haile said. “They almost should diverge.”\nMr. Goodhart, of Moat, suggested a shift in attitudes over the last year. “No individual media owner can be their own referee anymore,” he said. “You really can’t be against that.”\nAt a news conference during the recently concluded Advertising Week in Manhattan, Facebook executives seemed to concede as much, noting plans to focus more on metrics that they think advertisers should care about, like sales outcomes, though they did not offer a specific timeline for when that would happen.\n“There is very universal agreement that the industry needs to evolve to metrics that actually matter,” said Carolyn Everson, vice president for global marketing solutions at Facebook.","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/03/business/media/the-online-video-view-we-can-count-it-but-can-we-count-on-it.html","timestamp":"2016-10-15T21:19:25.786"}

Fandango Makes It Possible\nLOS ANGELES — By making it easy for people to buy movie tickets online or through a smartphone app, Fandango has experienced breakneck growth over the last two years. A couple of taps and presto! The seats are yours.\nBut that, Fandango has decided, is no longer good enough.\nTo keep growing — and, with any luck, help theaters and studios entice Americans, particularly young ones, to go to the movies at all — Fandango will alter course. Instead of relying on customers to come to it, Fandango will also go to them: Over the weekend, for instance, Fandango will begin selling tickets to Hollywood movies directly on Facebook.\nIn a first, Facebook users in the United States (only a portion initially) will be able to buy tickets — without leaving their news feeds — to coming films like “The Magnificent Seven,” starring Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt; “Storks,” a Warner Bros. animated movie; and the comedy concert movie “Kevin Hart: What Now?” While tested in rudimentary ways in the past, a robust, continual melding of movie ticket purchases with Facebook’s vast audience has never been done before, Paul Yanover, Fandango’s president, said.\n“It’s not just about purchasing ease, it’s also about bringing along groups of people,” Mr. Yanover said. “Hey, we’re going to see this movie. Why don’t you come along? Great. Boom. Done.”\nJulie Ask, an analyst with Forrester who was privately briefed by Fandango on its plans, offered an enthusiastic appraisal.\n“Consumers, particularly young ones, find it inconvenient to hop into different silos to get something done,” she said. “They want it all in one place. That sounds obnoxious, I know — the definition of a ‘first-world problem’ — but it’s true, and Fandango is solving it for them.”\nFacebook represents only one area of expansion for Fandango, which NBCUniversal owns. On Tuesday, Fandango began allowing users of Apple’s enhanced iPhone messaging app to buy tickets without leaving a texting conversation. Anyone using Apple’s new iOS 10 operating system can tap on a Fandango applet while on the Messages page. Posters for films playing in theaters pop up. Tapping a poster brings up a display of nearby theaters and showtimes, along with purchasing options.\nA Fandango interface designed for Snapchat (again, allowing users to buy tickets without toggling between apps or leaving the platform) is on the way. “This is about Fandango appearing in these environments in an organic, natural way — the way people communicate with each other now, the way they actually discover, plan and buy,” Mr. Yanover said.\nAlthough Mr. Yanover is not ready to show his full hand, he said in an interview at Fandango headquarters that additional offerings were in the works. Might Fandango, for instance, introduce ticket-buying on YouTube, where it operates a popular channel, Movieclips, stocked with trailers and snippets of old films? Mr. Yanover smiled, but declined to comment.\nSocial networks are crucial marketing tools for Hollywood, but actually acquiring customers has remained an elusive goal, in part because companies like Facebook have been more focused on other priorities. But that is changing. “There is now an arms race to offer more and more services and keep people in their environments longer,” Ms. Ask said.\nAnything that increases ticket sales is likely to be warmly embraced by studio executives and theater buyers, who have been fighting to keep moviegoing relevant as in-home entertainment options proliferate. About 513 million people went to the movies over the summer, a 3.5 percent decline compared with a year earlier, according to studio data. For the year so far, attendance is up about 1.2 percent.\n“The social aspect of what Fandango is doing is really important for Hollywood,” said Paul Dergarabedian, a senior media analyst at comScore. “Most people do not go to the movies alone, and there is the potential here to turn a two-ticket purchase into a four-ticket purchase.”\nFandango is facing competition from a start-up called Atom Tickets. Incubated by Lionsgate, with additional financing from Disney and 21st Century Fox, Atom has promoted itself as a way for theaters and studios to increase group sales by making it easier for friends to plan outings. The Atom app, introduced this year, has also made discounts, particularly for less popular showtimes, part of its mission, along with concession stand preorders.\nBut Fandango is the giant in this segment of the industry, servicing about 27,700 movie screens in the United States and growing quickly. So far this year, ticketing revenue is up 51 percent compared with the same period last year, according to a Fandango spokesman. In 2015, Fandango grew by 81 percent. About 70 percent of Fandango tickets are sold on mobile devices.\n“We’re really proud of our growth, and people will still come to us, but we’ve spent a lot of time watching how movie discovery and planning is changing,” Mr. Yanover said. “And I think these offerings we are unveiling are an important shift, not just for Fandango, but for Hollywood as a whole.”","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/16/business/media/buy-movie-tickets-on-facebook-fandango-makes-it-possible.html","timestamp":"2016-10-15T21:19:25.882"}

Transmitters on the ground or in satellites shoot that light through the air to receivers that can decode the data. (To understand this on simple terms, think of encoding and sending information through morse code using a flashlight.)\nOne longstanding obstacle to free-space optical communication is a trade-off between speed and size. To increase the number of laser signals hitting a receiver, one can increase the size of the receiver. But doing so makes the receiver slower.\nInstead, many free-space optical communication systems use smaller receivers with complex pointing and tracking systems. Because laser beams are narrow and travel in straight lines from point A to point B, these receivers have to continuously maneuver to catch laser beams head-on.\nImagine trying to water a small potted plant with a water gun from different angles, said Alan Willner, an optical communications scientist at the University of Southern California and president of the Optical Society, the professional society that published Internet.org’s paper. To maximize the amount of water you catch, you have to constantly move the pot around.\nThe Facebook researchers’ solution to this problem is a light detector that doesn’t need pointing and tracking, but still allows for fast transmission. To do this, they took advantage of fluorescence, the process of absorbing light and re-emitting it at a lower energy.\nFacebook’s detector contains a spherical bundle of special fluorescent fibers. The bundle, somewhere between the size of a golf ball and tennis ball, is able to absorb blue laser light from any direction and re-emit it as green light. Because that green light is diffuse, it can then be funneled to a small receiver that converts the light back to data.\nIn our hypothetical example, imagine that instead of a water gun, you’re pointing a blow dart gun at a water balloon attached to a funnel over the potted plant. As soon as you hit the balloon, it pops and releases water. With the addition of the balloon, you’ve eliminated the need to move the pot around. You can shoot at the water balloon from any direction, and the plant will get watered.\nFacebook’s new detector is able to achieve fast data rates of two gigabits per second — several orders of magnitude higher than those from radio frequencies — because light has a higher frequency than radio waves, and because the fluorescence process is fast. Free-space optical communication can also carry more information than radio communication, and is more secure because narrow laser beams are harder to intercept than wide radio waves.\nBecause of all these benefits, building on Facebook’s proof of concept holds tremendous potential not just for remote areas, but for meeting increased data demand all over the world, said Kamran Kiasaleh, an optical communications scientist at the University of Texas at Dallas who was not involved in the study.\nThe technology fits in with Facebook’s plans to beam internet access down from the skies using drones. With laser transmitters and arrays of these light detectors, drones could exchange data with one another and with ground stations. Indoors, these detectors could provide high data rates to mobile devices.\nFor now, the new light detector is still in early stages, said Tobias Tiecke, a communication systems scientist at Facebook and a co-author of the new paper. His team built their current device using off-the-shelf materials that are used for harvesting solar light.\n“The performance of our system can still be increased much further by developing materials tailored for communication,” he said.","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/22/science/facebook-wireless-light-internet.html","timestamp":"2016-10-15T21:19:26.555"}

Media companies and amateurs have found validation in surprisingly large audiences by posting on Facebook’s new video product, Live. Thousands of people show up to watch whenever a major Facebook page “goes live,” seemingly out of nowhere. Hundreds leave comments and ask questions. Facebook Live — the product — is working.\nBut not for everyone. Mention Facebook Live on Facebook — as we did the other day — and a chorus of slightly peeved voices emerge:\n“It’s an annoying notification is what it is.”\n“On the verge of being annoying.”\nSearch Twitter, and you’ll find links to guides for turning off Facebook Live notifications — a response to clear demand:\nWe probably shouldn’t be so surprised by this response. The videos are ranked high in the all-powerful Facebook news feed. Users who have subscribed to a news organization or celebrity page within Facebook, to see in their news feed an occasional update on current events or a change in hairstyle, are suddenly being bombarded by beckoning notifications that they didn’t really ask for.\nMedia companies control the notification pushes. Those that run large Facebook pages have been given the power to buzz thousands — sometimes millions — of pockets with notifications that they have “gone live.” This is new, and intoxicating — a chance to break out of the bustle of the news feed.\nThe appeal is increasingly familiar, a characteristic of an Internet built around platforms. Facebook Live is a technology, and a new way of doing things. But Facebook Live is also a feature within a larger system designed by Facebook. The company is in the privileged position of both releasing a product and controlling many of the conditions required for its success. Facebook didn’t just clear a little shelf space on the news feed for live video — it set down a big flashy floor display.\nLive is all about interruption — sometimes annoying, sometimes welcome, always attention-grabbing. Media companies say they have been shocked by the amount of interest in their Live experiments, including a flurry of earnest comments and questions for live streamers.\nBut then there is the issue of money. Executives at the companies remain somewhat wary about investing in yet another product without a clear sense of how it will pay off. Facebook is mostly mum about how — or when — money might flow from the videos.\nFacebook users have their own guesses, of course. Said one: “They’ll get more people using it, then hide the alerts because we’re already complaining and then charge companies to get the alerts back.”\nIs this just pessimism? Maybe. But even if Facebook Live unfolds exactly as this commenter imagines — a spike in viewers followed by a decline as the market becomes more competitive, and then Facebook becoming more sophisticated to promote and prioritize live streams — what would that tell us? That we’ve all been had, somehow? Or is it just that access to an audience is sometimes worth paying for?","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/02/technology/facebook-live-annoying-and-intrusive-seems-to-be-paying-off.html","timestamp":"2016-10-15T21:19:26.625"}

Spoiler alert: It’s not. But whether created by human or computer, what do we want from news?\nAs Mike Isaac reports, Facebook has published detailed information about how it chooses the news topics it puts before the 1.6 billion people on the social network. The company released the information under some duress, prodded by accusations that it was suppressing reports from conservative news outlets.\nBasically, Facebook said it used a base of computers putting possible stories from various places in front of human editors, who direct how these will be presented and displayed. Facebook said that it had a system of “checks and balances” that made sure a number of viewpoints were examined, and that it did not allow editors to “discriminate against sources of any political origin, period.”\nIt’s unclear whether the people who think Facebook did wrong will be appeased. All too often, where modern media is concerned, the general public assumes there is bias of one form or another. And Facebook did not seem to have sufficient details about how it made sure a human didn’t carry out a grudge by omitting one story or another.\nThere is a deeper issue at play as well, which has to do with the reasons Facebook is putting up the stories in the first place.\nLike Google, Facebook makes money by putting up ads concerning things its computers think you are interested in. And like Google, the content (search results or friend’s updates, depending on the company) that goes with the ads is chosen based on previous behavior.\nThere are several reasons for this, including giving you pleasure and not stressing or boring you with dissonance.\nThat is problematic where news is concerned, at least if the reader is seeking an objective viewpoint: Since new information can force us to change our minds, we have to want, on some level, to be stressed if we’re looking to be fully informed. In a slower-moving world, this was known as changing your mind.\nIs that what people want from news in a click-paced online world, though? The rise and success of specialty news outlets, which largely confirm their readers’ points of view, indicate that many people want to hear about the world, but through filters that affirm how they already feel about things.\nArguably, it was ever thus, and the right or the left had their own journals that people read. But the use of computer algorithms that know what you like stand to make it much more so.\nFacebook may struggle to take news from a lot more points of view, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to put them in front of you.","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/14/technology/facebook-and-the-problem-with-news-online.html","timestamp":"2016-10-15T21:19:27.240"}

He sees the letters as a reality check in a city and a political environment that can sometimes lose touch with the rest of the country’s day-to-day concerns.\n“And what’s interesting is not only do these letters help me to stay in touch with the people who sent me here or the people who voted against me, but a lot of times they identify problems that might not have percolated up through the various agencies and bureaucracies,” Mr. Obama said in the news release. “And more than once, there have been occasions where these letters inspired action on real problems that are out there.”\nIn recent years, Mr. Obama has increasingly reached into his letter bag to tell stories of how his administration has changed lives for the better and to give an emotional element to his speeches and appearances.\nBut as the habit of letter-writing wanes and a new generation comes of age enamored of social media, the White House has focused on tending to a new audience with new tools.\nMr. Obama has his own Twitter account, and Michelle Obama, the first lady, created a Snapchat account recently.\nTended by a bevy of digital-savvy aides in the White House, the accounts have little of the awkwardness of parental efforts at being cool. Some of the videos and other messages uploaded into the digital universe by the White House have gone viral, burnishing Mr. Obama’s image with younger people.\n“Technology makes it possible for anyone with an internet connection to send a message to the president and his administration,” Mr. Goldman wrote.\nFacebook and Google together claimed nearly two-thirds of the $60 billion online advertising market last year and are on course to take more this year. Facebook has become among the most important sources of news, with a recent survey finding that about half of those in 26 countries received their news from social media.","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/11/us/politics/obama-facebook.html","timestamp":"2016-10-15T21:19:27.270"}

BODY{"time":6,"sentiment":{"type":"negative","score":-0.6785714285714286},"lang":"en","text":"Was That a Debate? Or Were the Candidates Just Trying to Go Viral?\nAt the end of a rough night in the first presidential debate, Donald J. Trump congratulated himself for his restraint in not attacking his opponent with her husband’s sexual history.\nA lot can change in two weeks.\nThe most shocking and dispiriting visual of the second debate on Sunday appeared before the candidates even faced off. Mr. Trump held a surprise publicity event, broadcast on Facebook Live, with three women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual abuse, as well as one woman whose molester Hillary Clinton was assigned to defend as a young lawyer.\nThe session was brief, raw and surreal. People have said before that this election has hit rock bottom. This weekend, it climbed inside a steam drill, bored through the rock and headed straight for the center of the earth.\nYou did not have to look hard to see Mr. Trump’s motive. The debate took place two days after the most stunning hot-mike TV moment since Robert Durst burped out “Killed them all, of course,” on HBO’s “The Jinx.”\nIn a 2005 video first revealed by The Washington Post, Mr. Trump boasted, to a giggling Billy Bush of “Access Hollywood,” that he could force kisses on women and grab them by the genitals. The recording was creepy on its face. But as the most damaging scandals do, it also reinforced the candidate’s existing negatives: here, the impression that he sees women as objects.\nMr. Trump needed a viral moment to drown out his embarrassment from 2005. So he tried to bring back 1998.\nThe weekend’s frenzy had already recalled the first days of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Then, cable news went on red alert, political allies bolted, audiences were transfixed to see their president declaring, “I did not have sexual relations with that woman,” and pundits began speculating that Mr. Clinton would have to step down.\nNow Mr. Trump was reviving a right-wing narrative of Mrs. Clinton as enabling co-conspirator that had thrived around Mr. Clinton’s impeachment. When a reporter asked why Mr. Trump had said he touched women without their consent, Paula Jones — whose sexual-harassment lawsuit precipitated the Lewinsky investigation — cried out: “Why don’t you ask Bill Clinton that! Go ahead and ask Hillary as well!”\nHaving begun the weekend under fire as a man who sexually abuses women, Mr. Trump ended it accusing Mrs. Clinton of being married to one. He gave the women front-row seats at the debate — with Mr. Clinton in the crowd — counterprogramming his unscripted video scandal by staging a daytime talk-show drama.\nThat smoke-grenade overture hung a pall over the night. The candidates did not shake hands in greeting and both seemed tense. It looked as if this would be an ugly, personal debate.\nIt was, though Mr. Trump’s video and counter-accusations took up only a few minutes. To the one moderator, CNN’s Anderson Cooper, Mr. Trump denied that he had bragged about sexual assault. It was “locker-room talk,” he said, and anyway, ISIS was out there “chopping off heads.”\nMr. Trump mentioned his guests only briefly. Maybe they were there to rattle his opponent, maybe to rally his base. Or maybe they were a shield and a cudgel — a warning he might do anything if Mrs. Clinton brought up the video again.\nFrom there, the debate moved on to being vicious in entirely different ways. Mr. Trump promised to have his opponent investigated and jailed, recalling the “Lock her up!” chants of his convention. He loomed behind her physically, glowering and clasping his hands, like a security guard, or a prison guard. (Mrs. Clinton used the free-range format to approach the crowd often, framing Mr. Trump awkwardly behind her for the camera.)\nTown hall debates, held in front of undecided voters and appealing to a Norman Rockwell ideal of direct-democracy Americana, usually force a less combative tone — the “I feel your pain” approach Mr. Clinton excelled with in 1992. This time, the citizens sat uncomfortably close watching the two nominees deal the pain.\nMrs. Clinton was cautious-spoken, less effective than at the first debate at getting Mr. Trump to take bait and provoking him into outbursts. But she pressed attacks on his temperament and qualification when the questioners provided an opening. One asked about Islamophobia; answering another, she blamed a “Trump effect” for increasing bullying.\nMr. Trump, meanwhile, seemed better prepared with focused answers and lines of attack. Where he spent the first debate huffing and interrupting, this time he worked in sarcastic mode and improvised, jabbing Mrs. Clinton for comparing her view of political strategy to Abraham Lincoln’s: “Honest Abe never lied.”\nSome of the sharpest exchanges were with the moderators. The second moderator, Martha Raddatz of ABC, was especially assertive in keeping the candidates on time and on topic, particularly Mr. Trump. She even went beyond following up to argue with him, when he called American leaders “stupid” for announcing military offensives. “There are sometimes reasons the military does that,” Ms. Raddatz said. “Psychological warfare.”\nNo one watching these debates needs to be reminded of psychological warfare. Last time Mrs. Clinton set up Mr. Trump by bringing up his mocking of Alicia Machado, a former winner of his Miss Universe pageant, and needled him by inviting his billionaire adversary, Mark Cuban. This time, Mr. Trump, in prosecutorial mode, showed up with his own jury box.\nThe tactics seem driven by the same recognition: that what happens in the 90 minutes of a modern debate matters less than the conversation before and after. It’s less about sustaining an argument than creating moments — generating news clips and viral memes, setting up your opponent to misstep (sometimes, as with Ms. Machado, days afterward), trying to drive the narrative.\nThis debate offered several dark forks in the road ahead.","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/11/arts/television/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-second-debate.html","timestamp":"2016-10-15T21:19:27.857"}

Someone is shot on video, sometimes by the police, and marchers fill the streets. An attack is carried out in France, America, Turkey, Bangladesh, Lebanon, Tunisia, Nigeria, and then claimed and celebrated by a radical terror group.\nOur phones vibrate with news alerts. The talking heads fill air over cable news captions that shout “breaking news” in red. Rumors and misinformation abound. The comments erupt on Twitter, Facebook and news sites.\nJournalists create multimedia stories that focus on videos, photos and graphic accounts from victims and witnesses. The experts give interviews, and the latest tools of immediacy are put to use. After thedeadly terror attack in Nice, France, The Times invited grief counselors to be interviewed on Facebook Live. Within days, attention had turned to a shooting in Baton Rouge that left three law enforcement officers dead.\nSo, what is this doing to us?\nIt depends on the individual, but living in a digitally linked world where broadcasts of violence are instantaneous and almost commonplace means that many of us are becoming desensitized, Anita Gadhia-Smith, a psychologist in Washington, said Friday.\n“With the frequency of shootings and terror attacks there is a sense of anxiety that’s building in people,” she said, “a sense of vulnerability and powerlessness.”\nDr. Smith added: “There is a heightened alarm, but there can also be some desensitization that’s happening.”\nThe constant stream of news on social media can also be traumatic. A team of researchers at the University of Bradford in England told a British psychology conference last year that exposure to violent imagery on social media can cause symptoms that are similar to post-traumatic stress disorder, defined as a persistent emotional reaction to a traumatic event that severely impairs one’s life.\nIn an analysis conducted by the Bradford researchers, 189 participants were shown images and provided with stories of violent events, including the Sept. 11 attacks, school shootings and suicide bombings.\nThe researchers’ analysis showed that 22 percent of those who participated were significantly affected by what they saw.\nThe study also found that people who view violent events more often were more affected than people who saw them less frequently, and that people who described themselves as extroverts with outgoing personalities were at a higher risk to be disturbed by the images.\nWhat can we do about it?\nThe self-care advice hasn’t changed. It is natural to want to follow along with incremental updates on social media and in the news. But it’s important to know that this can heighten your anxiety.\nAnne Marie Albano, a clinical psychologist and the director of the Columbia University Clinic for Anxiety and Related Disorders, said in an interview after the 2015 Paris attacks that it might be a good idea to limit your exposure to social media.\nDesignating times to plug into the news — checking Twitter in the morning over coffee, but not listening to the radio while driving your kids to school, for instance — can help you manage anxiety if you are feeling stressed.\n“This will help you balance a realistic and credible threat with information that is sensationalized,” Dr. Albano said, “or a rush to report something or talk about something that doesn’t have the impact that you would think it has.”\nIf you’re feeling anxiety about a possible attack, compare your fear with the facts.\nWhen you fear the worst, it’s hard to remember that, say, a flight or a train ride has extraordinarily high odds of being safe. But you have to try.\nHumans are bad at assessing risk, Martin Seif, a psychologist who specializes in treating anxiety disorders and the fear of flying, said in an interview late last year.\n“Every single anxiety-management technique is based on the premise that your reaction is out of proportion” to the likelihood of danger, Dr. Seif said.\nAlso, remember to take a breath.\nA guide to dealing with terrorism released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation encourages closing your eyes and taking deep breaths to feel calmer.\nTaking a walk or talking to a close friend can also help.\nThe guide also recommends avoiding alcohol and drugs, exercising regularly and eating healthy foods — basic self-care guidelines that help reduce stress.\nMake sure you have a plan to contact your family if something happens, especially if cellular networks are overloaded or transportation is disrupted, but remember that you most likely will not need it, experts say.\nIf you have children, the American Psychological Association recommends asking them how they are feeling about the news. Keep in mind that it is possible for children to be influenced by news reports and the adult conversations around them.\nDr. Albano said that a primary worry in the field of psychology is people “going out of their way to be so safe that it shrinks their world.”\n“Terrorists thrive on this kind of thing,” she added. “They want to see the population change their practices.”\nGoing out of your way to avoid interacting with strangers — by refusing to take mass transit, for example — can stoke fear and anxiety in children, she said.\nThe best way to help children cope with acts of violence is to start by listening to them, Sean Rogers, a psychotherapist who works with children and teenagers, told The Times on his Facebook Live appearance.\n”Listening is curative,” he said. “It is the basis of all therapies.”","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/16/health/what-is-a-constant-cycle-of-violent-news-doing-to-us.html","timestamp":"2016-10-15T21:19:27.947"}
